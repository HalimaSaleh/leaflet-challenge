# Earthquake Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet and D3 libraries. It fetches earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON API and plots the earthquakes on an interactive map. The size of the markers represents the magnitude of the earthquakes, while the color indicates the depth. Additionally, a legend is provided to help interpret the depth color scale.

## Features
- Loads earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON API
- Displays earthquake markers on an interactive Leaflet map
- Marker size corresponds to earthquake magnitude
- Marker color reflects the depth of the earthquake
- Tooltip provides additional information about each earthquake (magnitude, location, depth)
- Legend explains the depth color scale
